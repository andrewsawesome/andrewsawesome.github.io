<h1>Repairibility of Electronics</h1>
<h2>Mobvoi Ticwatch E</h2>
<h3>Repairibility: Low</h3>
<p>The Ticwatch E is easy to open(using a T2 screwdriver), but it's easy to mess up the screen ribbon cable, and there aren't any replacement parts. If you have a broken Ticwatch E, it's best to send it to Mobvoi at <a href="https://support.mobvoi.com">support.mobvoi.com</a></p>
<h2>Apple iPhone 5</h2>
<h3>Repairibility: High</h3>
<p>The Apple iPhone 6 is very modular, and components are easily replaceable. It also has a tab for the battery. Just keep in mind you will need a pentalobe screwdriver to open it.</p>
  <h2>Texas Instruments TI-30XS Multiview Calculator</h2>
  <h3>Repairibility: Medium</h3>
  <p>Easy to open up(just remove the 6 Phillips screws on the back and pop off the back), however, the only easily replaceable component is the CR2032 battery.</p>
