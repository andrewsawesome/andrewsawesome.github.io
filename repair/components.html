  <h1>Electronic Components</h1>
  <p>By understanding how electronic components work, it will be easier to find faulty components and replace them.</p>
  <h2>Capacitors</h2>
  <p>Capacitors are like rechargeable batteries with 2 differences.</p>
<ol>
  <li>They tend to release their energy quicker</li>
  <li>They last many more “recharge cycles”</li>
  </ol>
  <p>While capacitors are similar to batteries, they are NOT batteries.</p>

  <p>There are 3 main types of capacitors:</p>
  <li>Ceramic capacitors</li>
  <li>Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors(Electrolytic Capacitor)</li>
  <li>Tantalum Electrolytic capacitors</li>
  <li>Safety Capacitors(And other film capacitors)</li>
<p>Ceramic capacitors are the simplest and lowest-capacity capacitors. They use the simple methodology of capacitor design-two metals on either side of a dielectric. In the case of the ceramic capacitor, the dielectric is a ceramic disk. Being simple and small, these store a very low amount of electricity.</p>
  <p></p>
<p>Aluminum electrolytic capacitors hold much more capacity, but after about 20 years, it will start to leak and corrode. Electrolytic capacitors use tissue(dielectric) covered by foil(electrode). The capacitor is then soaked in electrolyte.</p>
  <p></p>
<p>Tantalum capacitors consist of anode and cathode foils, with a dielectric of paper impregnated with liquid electrolyte. This does not leak and corrode when it dies, but instead shorts and acts like a wire.</p>
  <p></p>
<p>Film capacitors are primarily used for safety, going across the live wire. They are made from two pieces of plastic film(dielectric) covered in metal foil/metal film(electrode). If you see an old one of these, you should replace them.</p>
