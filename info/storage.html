<h1>Storage Info.</h1>
<h2>Portable</h2>
<h3>USB Drive</h3>
<p>The USB drive is one of the cheapest forms of flash storage. The main parts in a USB drive are the flash storage and USB controller.</p>
<h3>SD Card</h3>
<h4>General</h4>
<p>The SD card also contains flash storage. By cutting out the USB controller, hovever, the SD card is able to be cheaper. </p>
<h4>Types</h4>
<p>SD cards nowadays are almost always 8GB. However, if youbought an SD card in the early days, you would marvel at the storage size of SD cards nowadays. </p>
<h5>SD</h5>
<p>The first generation of SD cards had a storage limit of 2GB. If you had anything that will only take up to 2GB, it's because it was made for original SD cards. </p>
<h5>SDHC</h5>
<p>Next was the SDHC standard. This is the one that a lot of us are using today. SDHC has a limit of 32GB. This is why a lot of electronics, namely cheap dash cams and Raspberry Pis, only accept up to 32GB SD cards.</p>
<h5>SDXC</h5>
<p>SDXC stands for SD Extreme Capacity, and extreme it is. SDXC supports up to 2TB cards, which aren't even available on the consumer market yet. However, electronics that support SDXC may not support larger sizes.</p>
<h4>Sizes</h4>
<p>Most SD cards right now are micro SD cards. If you've bought a micro SD card, you'll find an adapter in the box, which is the size of a normal SD card.</p>
<h3>DVD</h3>
<h3>CD</h3>
<h3>3.5" Floppy Disks</h3>
  <p>3.5" Floppy Disks are the more common, more rigid, floppy disks. 3.5" Floppy disks come in 2 storage sizes.</p>
  <h4>Low Density</h4>
  <p>The earlier low density floppy disks have a capacity of 720 KB when IBM formatted. These have one hole, on the bottom left.</p>
  <h4>High Density</h4>
  <p>These account for most floppy disks you will find today. High Density floppy disks are 1.44 MB when formatted, and have 2 holes at the bottom.</p>
