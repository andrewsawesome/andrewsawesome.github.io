<h1>Why I Hate Chromebooks</h1>
<ol>
<li>Lack of Native Apps</li>
<p>Although Chrome OS is getting better at this, there is still a lack of native apps. For example, there is no native audio recorder or screen capture software for Chrome OS.</p>
<li>Driver Issues(and no way to solve them)</li>
<p>Especially on cheaper chromebooks, there tends to be driver issues. And with virtually no troubleshooting options, you are forced to restart the computer and see if the issue goes away.</p>
<li>Lack of Flexibility</li>
<p>Another space where Chromebooks are getting better is flexibility. You can now(at best) run native Chrome OS apps, Android apps, and <a href="/linux-apps-on-chromebook">GNU/Linux apps</a>(Including VirtualBox and VMWare). However, the Android app integration still doesn’t work well, and you need to have a higher specification Chromebook to be able to run Linux apps(and an Intel or AMD if you want to run Virtualbox or VMware). </p>
<li>Low Specs</li>
<p>Picking a Chromebook means you tend to get lower specs than a similarly priced Windows computer. Instead of 240 GB hard drives, you get 64 GB or even just 32 GB eMMC storage, sometimes leaving you with a total of 3 GB storage. In addition, a lot of them contain ARM processors, which means you can’t use <a href="/virtualization">virtualization</a> software like VirtualBox or VMWare, and can only use Linux apps compiled to work with ARM processors.</p>
<li>Can't Use Other Browsers Easily</li>
<p>While this may not seem like a big deal, Chrome can be a buggy browser. To switch to another browser, you either have to have an Intel or AMD processor and use the Linux environment, or you have to use a mobile browser from the Android app store.</p>
<li>Lack of Upgradability</li>
<p>Basically all Chromebooks today feature soldered-on RAM, meaning you can’t upgrade your Chromebook after you buy it. In addition, many also feature soldered-on storage, making it difficult, if not impossible, to get data off of your Chromebook that was stored locally</p>
