<h1>Nobody Told Me Lyrics</h1>
<p></p>
<p>3!4!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Everybody's Talking, and no one says a word</p>
<p>Everybody's Making Love, and no one really cars</p>
<p>There's Nazis in the bathroom, just below the stairs</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Always something happening, and nothing going on</p>
<p>There's always something cooking, and nothing in the pot</p>
<p>They're Starving back in China, so finish what you got.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Nobody told me there'd be days like these</p>
<p>Nobody told me there'd be days like these</p>
<p>Nobody told me there'd be days like these</p>
<p>Strange Days indeed, strange days indeed</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Everybody's running, and no one makes a move</p>
<p>Everyone's a winner, and nothing's left to lose</p>
<p>There's a little yellow idol, to the north of Katmandu</p>
<p>Everybody's flying, and no one leaves the ground</p>
<p>Everybody's crying, and no one makes a sound</p>
<p>There's a place for us in the movies, you just gotta lay around</p>
