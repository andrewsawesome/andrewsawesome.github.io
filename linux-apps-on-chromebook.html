  <h2>The two methods of installing linux apps</h2>
  <h3>1. Installing via terminal</h3>
  <p>This is the simplest way to install (at least some) Linux apps. This involves the 4 steps below. If you can't install the app via terminal, try one of the other app install methods listed below.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the terminal by going into the Chrome OS launcher and finding the terminal</li>
    <li>When the terminal opens up, type <code>sudo apt-get update</code> and press enter. If you get an error, don't worry about it and move on to the next step.</li>
    <li>After installing any applicable update by pressing y and hitting enter, type <code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code>, and press enter. if you get an error, don't worry about it and move on to the next step. If you get a prompt, installing any applicable update by pressing y and hitting enter.</li>
    <li>Now it's time to install the app. Type <code>sudo apt-get install app-name</code> and press enter, replacing app-name with the app you're installing. To install LibreOffice, for example, type <code>sudo apt-get install libreoffice</code>.</li>
    <h3>2. Installing via the website</h3>
    <p>The other way to install an app is by visiting the app's website and downloading the installation file. After doing this, navigate to the section that applies to your app</p>
    <h4>.deb Apps</h4>
    <p>After locating the folder where the .deb app was saved, select it and select "Open with Linux(Beta)"</p>
    <h4>.deb.tar.gz Apps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Drag the app to the Linux(Beta) folder</li>
      <li>Create a folder with the name of your app(inside the Linux folder)</li>
      <li>Drag your app file into the folder you just created.</li>
      <li>Open the terminal app</li>
      <li>Run <code>sudo tar -xf [filename].deb.tar.gz</code>. After typing two or three letters, you can use the tab key to fill in the rest of the filename.</li>
      <li>Run <code>ls</ocde> to find the folder name for your app</li>
      <li>Run <code>cd/[FolderName]/</code>, followed by the <code>ls</code> command. Again, you can use the tab key to fill in the folder name after typing a few letters.</li>
      <li>You should see a folder called DEBS or similar. Run <code>cd/DEBS</code> (or the folder name).</li>
      <li>Run <code>sudo dpkg -I *.deb</code></li>
