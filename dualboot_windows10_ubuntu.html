  <h1>How to dual Boot Windows and Ubuntu/Lubuntu</h1>
  
  <h2>Do I have the right supplies</h2>
  <p>To dual boot or live boot Linux with Windows, you will need the following things: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> A Computer with Windows7 or later</li>
    <li> A drive with 4-8 GB memory(you can tyr one with more memory</li>
    <li>Internet that your computer can access</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h2>What type of OS should I Download</h2>
  <p>For most recent computers(that aren't running super slow) I would recommend Ubuntu. For a 32 bit computer and/or a computer running Windows Vista or earlier, I would recommend Lubuntu. Next, check your computer. If your computer is 32 bit, you need to download the 32 bit version of the OS. If you're not sure, download the 32 bit version.</p>
  <h2>Download Rufus</h2>
  <p>To donwload Rufus, go <a href="rufus.ie">here</a>, scroll to "Download", and click the Rufus 3.10 link(version may differ, it will be the first and biggest link in the download section)</p>
  <p>Next, run the setup installer to install Rufus/belenaEtcher</p>
  <h2>Download your OS</h2>
  <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download">Download Ubuntu here</a>
  <a href="https://lubuntu.me/downloads/">Download Lubuntu here</a>
  <p>Make sure to download the 32 bit version if you're planning to use the OS on a 32 bit PC</p>
  <h2>Make a bootable USB stick</h2>
  <p>Watch the video below. Make sure to click "yes" when Windows asks if you want to allow the app to make changes to your device</p>
