<title>Dual Booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu</title>
  <h1>How to dual Boot Windows and Ubuntu/Lubuntu</h1>
  
  <h2>Do I have the right supplies</h2>
  <p>To dual boot or live boot Linux with Windows, you will need the following things: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> A Computer with Windows 7 or later/MacOS 10.1 or later/Linux(to write the USB drive)</li>
    <li>A Target Computer running Windows(can be the same one you used to write the USB drive)</li>
    <li> A drive with 4-8 GB memory(you can try one with more memory</li>
    <li>Internet that your target computer can access</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h2>What type of OS should I Download</h2>
  <p>For most recent computers(that aren't running super slow) I would recommend Ubuntu. For a 32 bit computer and/or a computer running Windows Vista or earlier, I would recommend Lubuntu. Next, check your computer. If your computer is 32 bit, you need to download the 32 bit version of the OS. If you're not sure, download the 32 bit version.</p>
  <h2>Download Rufus/belenaEtcher</h2>
  <p>To donwload Rufus, go <a href="rufus.ie">here</a>, scroll to "Download", and click the Rufus 3.10 link(version may differ, it will be the first and biggest link in the download section)</p>
  <p>To download belenaEtcher, go <a href="balena.io/etcher">here</a>, then choose your OS in the drop-down menu.</p>
  <p>Next, run the setup installer to install Rufus/belenaEtcher</p>
  <h2>Download your OS</h2>
  <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download">Download Ubuntu here</a>
  <a href="https://lubuntu.me/downloads/">Download Lubuntu here</a>
  <p>Make sure to download the 32 bit version if you're planning to use the OS on a 32 bit PC</p>
  <h2>Make a bootable USB stick</h2>
  <h3>For Rufus(Windows)</h3>
  <p>Watch the video below. Make sure to click "yes" when Windows asks if you want to allow the app to make changes to your device</p>

  <h2>Booting from the USB drive</h2>
  <p>After you write the drive, safely eject the usb drive(it will be under a boot partition), and plug it into your target computer(if your target computer is the one you're already on, you don't need to do anything).</p>
  <h3>For Windows 7 and earlier</h3>
  <p>First, look up the boot menu key for your computer</p>
  <p>Make sure the target computer is off(if it isn't shut it down). Plug in your USB drive and a usb keyboard and mouse.</p>
  <p>Turn on your computer. When you see the manufacturer logo, press your boot menu key. You should see a menu come up.</p>
  <p>Press the down arrow on your keyboard until your USB drive is highlighted. Press Enter</p>
  <p>You should see a menu. Press Enter or wait until it disappears. From here, you can test out Ubuntu/Lubuntu and install it alongside Windows.</p>
  <h3>For Windows 8/8.1</h3>
  <p>Press the Windows key and the I key on your keyboard simultaneously.</p>
  <p>Click Update and Recovery, then click Recovery.</p>
  <p>Click the Restart Now button under Advanced Startup</p>
  <p>At the "Choose an option" screen , click "Use a device, then click "EFI USB Device"</p>
  <p>You should see a menu. Press Enter or wait until it disappears. From here, you can test out Ubuntu/Lubuntu and install it alongside Windows.</p>
  <h3>For Windows 10</h3>
  <p>Press the Windows key and the I key on your keyboard simultaneously.</p>
  <p>Click Update and security, then click Recovery</p>
  <p>Click the Restart Now button under Advanced Startup</p>
  <p>At "Choose an option", click "Use a device, then click "EFI USB Device"</p>
  <p>You should see a menu. Press Enter or wait until it disappears. From here, you can test out Ubuntu/Lubuntu and install it alongside Windows.</p>
