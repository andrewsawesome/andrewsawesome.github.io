<title>Take it Easy Lyrics</title>
<p>Well, I'm running down down the road trying to loosen my load</p>
<p>I got seven women on my mind</p>
<p>Four that wanna own me</p>
<p>Two that wanna stone me</p>
<p>One says she's a friend of mine</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Take it easy, take it easy</p>
<p>Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy</p>
<p>Lighten up while you still can</p>
<p>Don't even try to understand</p>
Just Find a place to make your stand, and take It Easy</p>
<p>---</p>
