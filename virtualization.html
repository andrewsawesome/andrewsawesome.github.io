<h1>Virtaulizing Operating Systems Using Virtualbox/VMWare</h1>
<p>Virtualizing operating systems is a great way to try and use operating systems like Windows, Linux, and MS-DOS. Below I have The two most common virtualization softwares and tutorials for installation of a few operating systems inside Virtualboxx/VMware</p>

  <p>The first question you need to answer is which virtualization software you want to use. I recommend Virtualbox because of a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>It's free for both consumer and commercial use</li>
<li>It's open source</li>
<li>You can organize your operating systems in groups</li>
<li>It runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS(The free version of VMWare only runs on Windows and Linux</li>
  </ol>
<h3>Click the Virtualbox icon above and choose your operating system to install Virtualbox</h3>

  </a>
  <p>The other option is VMWare. You might want to install VMWare for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy Install(VMWare will setup some newer Windows versions automatically)</li>
<li>If you're having problems installing Virtualbox or an operating system in virtualbox, or if a virtual machine will not install in Virtualbox</li>
</ol>
<h3>Install VMWare by clicking the icon above, and choosing your operating system</h3>
