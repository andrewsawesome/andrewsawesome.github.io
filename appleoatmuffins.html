Yay! Excited to try more stuff from your site. I've got an overnight oat smoothie sitting in my fridge right now. I might just have to go to bed now so I can enjoy breakfast. o; I love apples, and it's fall.. Apple and pumpkin cravings are kicking in.

Love the low sugar and less fat!  Applesauce is not a pantry staple for me in Australia so I diced and lightly cooked 4 small apples with a little water, juice of one orange and added the cinnamon (freshly ground as I only had cinnamon sticks left) to the saucepan. Added this and skipped the fresh apple. For a twist I added a good handful of walnuts at the end! Delicious.

I made these muffins last night so he would have something easy to grab and go in the morning. I got the phone call on break this morning saying he loved the muffins! I only made a few slight changes: I used half white whole wheat and half all purpose flour, I used 1/4 cup coconut oil instead of applesauce since I didn't have any and then I needed to add a couple splashes of milk because the batter was super thick and I didn't want to overmix. I tried one also this morning and thought they were great. Not that sweet but also not bland. When I make again I might add some pure maple syrup for sweetness. Great muffin recipe :)"},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lindsay"},"datePublished":"2017-07-01","reviewBody":"Just made a triple batch of these for the freezer.

I have added dates instead of raisins sometimes with great results and I have even added some coconut.

<p>I think I just found my newest grab-n-go breakfast obsession.</p>



<p>But before we&nbsp;get into that, can we just talk about breakfast in general? Because in an effort to combat&nbsp;a serious case of the &#8220;<em>durrrrr&#8230; what?</em>&#8220;s (<em>aka: writer&#8217;s block</em>), I figured I would talk about the first thing that came to mind, and&#8230; <em>BAM</em>&#8230; breakfast.was.<em>it.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why I&#8217;m thinking about breakfast at 3 PM on a gorgeous Tuesday afternoon is anyone&#8217;s guess, but we&#8217;re just going to roll with it.&nbsp;<em>Keep rollin&#8217;, rollin&#8217;, rollin&#8217;, rollin&#8217; (what!).</em>&nbsp;Err. Sorry. Had a&nbsp;little <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYnFIRc0k6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Limp Bizkit</strong></a> moment&nbsp;there.</p>



<p><em>Anyways&#8230;</em></p>

<p>I love breakfast.&nbsp;<em>Love</em>. It&#8217;s not rare for me to eat a breakfast-type food for all my main meals, and while I wouldn&#8217;t say breakfast is&nbsp;the reason I&nbsp;get out of bed in the morning, it&#8217;s definitely&nbsp;one of the highlights of my day. Which just makes it sound like I lead an incredibly dull life, but whatever&#8230; I&#8217;m going with it. No backspace in this post. Or &#8220;delete,&#8221; as is the case on my Mac.</p>



<p><em>Ugh</em>.&nbsp;See where my brain goes when I let it? All over the place. Back to the point&#8230;</p>

<p>Truth be told, I&#8217;ll never understand people who don&#8217;t love breakfast (<i>or who don&#8217;t eat it at all 😯&nbsp;</i>). I mean, I try to keep an open mind when it comes to&nbsp;different&nbsp;eating habits and dietary preferences, but&#8230; breakfast haters &#8212;&nbsp;<em>you nuts!&nbsp;</em>Oatmeal, pancakes, waffles, crepes, cereal, smoothies, muffins, coffee&#8230;&nbsp;<em>be still my&nbsp;pounding heart</em>.</p>



<p>And if you noticed that I left things like hash browns, eggs, and bacon off my list, it&#8217;s because this girl likes her breakfasts&nbsp;<em>sweet</em>. The only exception to the rule&nbsp;would be&nbsp;cold leftover pizza, and that&#8217;s only&nbsp;because it brings back fond memories of my late teens and early twenties. Memories that we&#8217;re not going to get into in today&#8217;s post.&nbsp;<em>Brain!</em> Move along *<em>makes shooing motion with her hands</em>*&#8230;</p>

<p>Where was I.&nbsp;<em>Ahh yes.</em></p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been through a tonne of breakfast phases in my day. The kind where you fixate on one food and eat it every morning for months and months on end before moving on to your next obsession? There was a cereal phase. An Eggo phase. A Poptart phase. A granola bar phase. A muffin-as-big-as-my-head-phase. An oatmeal phase. And, most recently, a smoothie phase.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s assuming I&#8217;m at home with plenty of time to leisurely enjoy my noms (<em>tell me I didn&#8217;t just say &#8216;noms&#8217;&#8230; ugh</em>). If I [<em>hypothetically</em>]&nbsp;sleep in, need to get ready and leave home early, or I&#8217;m just feeling lazy and want to be in-and-out of the kitchen in less than 2.2, then these&nbsp;<strong>Apple Oat Greek Yogurt Muffins</strong> are perfection. Heck, they&#8217;re perfection even&nbsp;without all of those conditions, but let&#8217;s just keep the breakfast train going&#8230;</p>

<p>These muffins were inspired by my ever-popular <a href="https://www.runningwithspoons.com/2014/06/24/banana-oat-greek-yogurt-muffins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Banana Oat Greek Yogurt Muffins</strong></a>&#8230; with a few changes.</p>



<p>First, <strong>apples</strong> instead of bananas.&nbsp;<em>Obviously</em>. Second, the&nbsp;inclusion of&nbsp;plain old flour. I tried making these muffins solely with oats, and while it still <em>worked</em>, it didn&#8217;t work quite as well.&nbsp;I mean, they still <em>tasted</em> amazing, but they looked a little wonky and the texture was a bit off&#8230;&nbsp;Nothing serious, but denser than I wanted.</p>



<p>In any case, these apple muffins are good stuff. They&#8217;re <strong>oil-free</strong>, contain a <strong>minimal amount of added sugar</strong>, and have a good amount of <strong>protein</strong> and <strong>fibre</strong> thanks to the yogurt and&nbsp;oats. But, more importantly, they taste fabulous. The combination of apples, yogurt, and oats is to.die.for, and the fact that they&#8217;re soft&nbsp;and dense&nbsp;just makes them a pleasure to eat.</p>



<p>Happy eating!</p>

			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 350F (176C) and prepare a muffin pan by spraying the cavities with cooking spray or lining them with paper liners. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Set aside.</li>
<li>Lightly beat the egg in a separate bowl. Whisk in the yogurt, applesauce, brown sugar, vanilla, and grated apple, stirring until well-combined.</li>
<li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing gently until just combined. Fold in the raisins.</li>
<li>Divide the batter evenly among the 12 muffin cups, filling them almost to the top. Add a sprinkle of oats if desired.</li>
<li>Bake the muffins for 20-22 minutes, or until top is firm to the touch and toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in pan for ~10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Store them in an air-tight container for up to 5 days, or freeze them for up to 3 months.</li>

			<h3>Notes</h3>
			<p>* You can also use a mix of all-purpose and whole wheat. I&#8217;d suggest 1/2 cup (60 g) of AP and 1/2 cup (60 g) of whole wheat.<br />
** Do not use quick oats. They are too fine and will dry out the muffins too much.</p>

			<p>What a delicious-looking recipe!! I went through several breakfast phases: the cereal mess, the green smoothie, the overnight oats&#8230; But for the past year or so I have been loving oatmeal. It&#8217; so versatile and comforting. I can&#8217;t get enough! Especially with almond butter on top.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m so with you about breakfast phases- when I like something, I tend to eat/drink it for days!  Like you, lately that phase has been based around smoothies- I can&#8217;t get enough! Aside from smoothies, I&#8217;ve gone through phases of waffles, oatmeal, overnight oats, yogurt messes &amp; eggs with toast.   I&#8217;m a huge fan of apple-flavored baked goods so I am loving this muffin variation&#8230;love the idea of snacking on them!</p>

			<p>Okay this breakfast sounds weird but I&#8217;ve been eating sweet potatoes with greek yogurt, nut butter and a little granola or nuts for crunch. I also love sweet potatoes with goat cheese and eggs. I&#8217;ve done the oatmeal phase, overnight oats phase, smoothie phase, greek yogurt and fruit phase&#8230; I&#8217;ve been switching it up more than normal lately which is weird for me!</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again&#8230; you are the QUEEN of muffins! And I&#8217;ve been doing a weird cycle with my breakfasts as well. I went through  major oatmeal obsession, which lasted about a year, to a scrambled egg obsession, and now I&#8217;m kinda just coasting along with whatever strikes my fancy (and I&#8217;m totally jumping onboard your smoothie bandwagon as well. Hope there&#8217;s room for me 😉 )</p>
<p>Pinning! And hopefully eating as soon as I restock my kitchen with apples!</p>

			<p>I totally went through a phase where Pop Tarts were daily noms (hehe!) when I was watching Gilmore Girls, as they always ate Pop Tarts and because I didn&#8217;t grow up with anything fun, I decided that as an adult, I would eat whateverthehellIwanted. Fruit Loops were an option, but they hurt the roof of my mouth.</p>

			<p>Breakfast is my absolute favorite too. I can&#8217;t even begin to relate with people who don&#8217;t like it.<br />
These look absolutely perfect! The apples and the oats sound so good together. And I had to laugh at the Limp Biskit reference. That takes me back just a few years, 😉</p>

			<p>For more, breakfast is all about the nana ice cream (just a hint addicted). If I don&#8217;t have time for that, my go-to is a big bowl of chocolate oatmeal (cause, hey, who can turn down chocolate?) I just whipped up some killer vanilla chia seed pudding for this morning, though, so I may have some competition&#8230;.</p>

			<p>YES. Agreed, 100%. Breakfast is THE BEST.  Lately, I&#8217;ve been craving PB &amp; banana toast.  I love how simple yet delicious the combo is.<br />
I&#8217;ve also been eating yogurt bowls. I go through phases where I eat yogurt bowls ALL THE TIME then won&#8217;t touch &#8217;em for weeks or months. I&#8217;m happy to be back on the bandwagon.</p>

			<p>I tried soooo many different times to eat breakfast in the morning, but my stomach cannot handle anything before I workout. I just burp it up the entire time &#8211; uncomfortable. This is where protein powder as a &#8220;creamer&#8221; becomes useful in my life. ANYWAYZZZZ, I just told my mom yesterday I could live off of breakfast foods when we left the diner. Oatmeal, pancakes, and waffles&#8230; I&#8217;m sold. It&#8217;s like a warm hug.</p>

			<p>Greek yogurt is one of my favorite additions to baked goods! It makes them so moist and more fluffy to me! PS: I love how you call it &#8216;plain&#8217; flour instead of white flour! 🙂</p>

			<p>These muffins look gorgeous! I actually made something similar recently using spelt flour and the texture was perfect. I didn&#8217;t use greek yogurt though.  I may try making these with spelt flour and leaving out the sugar so my baby girl can have some too!</p>

			<p>I have to admit that I recently put Limp Bizkit on my workout playlist.  &#8220;Break Stuff.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a great song first thing in the morning 😉</p>
<p>Omg the breakfast phases.  I&#8217;m definitely guilty of that.  The most memorable would be the vanilla greek yogurt/granola/fruit breakfast that I had every single morning for over a year, (with a very specific brand of yogurt and granola,) and then the more recent eggs/chicken apple sausage that also lasted about a year.  Now I&#8217;m doing different things with my diet so my breakfast is varied depending on the day, but it&#8217;s still pretty redundant.  I tend to stay pretty happily in food ruts until all of a sudden I can&#8217;t stand it anymore.</p>

			<p>I definitely find that to be the case for me as well. And I do the same thing with music! Play a song on repeat for weeks until I can&#8217;t stand it anymore and don&#8217;t listen to it again for a few years 😆</p>

			<p>I love breakfast. I am, however, quite lazy about it if I don&#8217;t have things already made. I love to make some egg white/cheese english muffins with Ezekiel english muffins to keep in the freezer. SO good. But I love sweets also, so muffins and the recipe you just posted would work perfect for me as well. I can do sweet pretty much any (all) the time 😉</p>

			<p>I adore breakfast too. Best meal of the day! I can&#8217;t really remember what I ate for breakfast in high school, but in early university I loved the tater tots and scrambled eggs from the cafeteria. Then I switched to yogurt with banana and cereal, then oatmeal, and then&#8230;. wait, I&#8217;m still in my oatmeal phase. 😛</p>
<p>These look delicious! And perfect for me because I&#8217;ve been wanting to do some baking but I swear 3/4 of my pinned recipes call for ripe bananas, which I never seem to have on hand because I eat them too quickly lol.</p>

			<p>I cycle through smoothies, overnight oats and my current obsession, peanut butter, banana and jelly sandwiches. I usually favor smoothies in the summer and oats in the fall. These phases do not last long because I love peanut butter and jelly so much I can&#8217;t really resist this breakfast 🙂 The muffins look great! Have you ever considered a vegan yogurt?</p>

			<p>Love it! Muffins are one of my favorite grab and go breakfasts (mostly because I&#8217;m a little too fond of my snooze button) and these sound like a delicious addition to my usual rotation.</p>

			<p>I made your Banana Oat Greek Yoghurt muffins about a week ago and my three year old ate four of them (they were mini ones!) and announced, &#8220;these are delicious, mum!&#8221;.  This from the child who usually turns his nose up at my healthy muffin creations.  Personally, I did find them a little bit dense so I am really looking forward to trying these apple ones with the flour.  Hopefully, it passes the Little Person Test!<br />
Thanks for the recipe.<br />

			<p>I&#8217;m not a breakfast person, mostly because I don&#8217;t have time to eat during the morning. I wake at 4:30 and I&#8217;m at work working by 5:30. So I&#8217;ve been looking for quick, eat on the run, breakfasts. These look delicious and I&#8217;ve pinned them to make later this weekend.</p>

			<p>Hello!<br />
I made these muffins today and I didn&#8217;t see your comment about not using quick oats and I did use them. But the muffins turned out light and moist and not dry at all! And really really yummy I must add!<br />
Going to make these as a swap for store bought granola bars that I take with me for snacks&#8230; also gonna try and add other dried fruit to them XD</p>

			<p>Ohwow! *She is totally excited about finding a new website with more than one recipe that tastes amazing and is healthy.*  This looks, super tasty. Yay! Excited to try more stuff from your site. I&#8217;ve got an overnight oat smoothie sitting in my fridge right now. I might just have to go to bed now so I can enjoy breakfast. o; I love apples, and it&#8217;s fall.. Apple and pumpkin cravings are kicking in. And eheh, First thing I thought of  when you said &#8220;rollin&#8217; rollin&#8217; rollin'&#8221; was the intro to Rawhide. My gosh, I need to &#8220;get with the times.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Thanks for this recipe! Love the low sugar and less fat!  Applesauce is not a pantry staple for me in Australia so I diced and lightly cooked 4 small apples with a little water, juice of one orange and added the cinnamon (freshly ground as I only had cinnamon sticks left) to the saucepan. Added this and skipped the fresh apple. For a twist I added a good handful of walnuts at the end! Delicious. My young adult sons have already demolished half the dozen!</p>

			<p>DELICIOUS!!! I made these muffins, and they were so moist and fulfilling! I detest baking that you know is healthy and isn&#8217;t worth it to eat. But these muffins didn&#8217;t cheat me!.I made some changes…I used 2 eggs instead of 1, added 1/4 c coconut oil, oodles of cinnamon. I replaced half the sugar with stevia, then used the remaining half of the sugar to sprinkle on top of the muffins with cinnamon (added a nice layer to the top). I also threw in a bowl of leftover sliced strawberries that I had to use up, which ended up pairing well with the apple. Will keep this recipe in my list of favourites!</p>

			<p>These smell Devine. As someone said before, I was on the lookout for an apple baking recipe and found yours. I used half a cup of plain flour and half a cup of buckwheat. Can&#8217;t wait to try them tomorrow!</p>

			<p>As every other recipe I&#8217;ve tried from you, this was perfect! I diced my apples because I was too lazy to get out the grater, used whole wheat flour &amp; subbed bananas for apple sauce as I didn&#8217;t have any on hand I also added 1/2 C white choc chips.<br />
My kids LOVE them, as do I. Thank you!<br />
I&#8217;m trying to give 5 stars but I can only click up to 4!</p>

			<p>My husband is adjusting to a new schedule that has him up and out of the house before I&#8217;m even awake so he&#8217;s not home anymore for breakfast. I made these muffins last night so he would have something easy to grab and go in the morning. I got the phone call on break this morning saying he loved the muffins! I only made a few slight changes: I used half white whole wheat and half all purpose flour, I used 1/4 cup coconut oil instead of applesauce since I didn&#8217;t have any and then I needed to add a couple splashes of milk because the batter was super thick and I didn&#8217;t want to overmix. I tried one also this morning and thought they were great. Not that sweet but also not bland. When I make again I might add some pure maple syrup for sweetness. Great muffin recipe 🙂</p>

			<p>Just made a triple batch of these for the freezer. I&#8217;m 38 weeks pregnant and these will be perfect for late night nursing sessions! (And my other kids will steal them&#8230;.hence the triple batch 😂). My house smells so good right now!</p>

			<p>I discovered these and LOVE them! THANK YOU!!!  I have intestinal issues and try to avoid wheat, so I subbed the flour with 3/4 oat flour and 1/4 rice flour.  I also add 1 tablespoon of oat bran to up the fibre level. I have added dates instead of raisins sometimes with great results and I have even added some coconut. These are my go-to breakfast!</p>

			<p>Here is the thing when I wake up my tummy is unstable. Even as a kid if my mother fed me breakfast&#8230; to be polite I will just say I couldn&#8217;t keep it down every.day.no.matter.what. You get the point. As a teen I got so I could manage a bit of non-breakfast food (ie pizza). As an adult I just need to drink coffee till noonish and then I brunch. Always on savory foods, never sweet. This is my body and how it reacts to food and always has. However now I have these two short people that call me mom and unlike me they feel the need to eat in the morning. I was looking for some healthy breakfast foods that will pass their strict regulations and found these muffins. I can&#8217;t wait to try them!  This looks like an awesome recipe. Thanks.</p>
