<p>Immigration PaperAndrew Schindler Señorita Papadopoulos Period 8 Spanish 6 October 2019 How We Can Fix the Immigration System  The current immigration system is flawed. In this essay, I will highlight examples of how legal immigration is flawed, and steps for making the legal immigration process more accessible to immigrants. One major problem is immigration caps. No one country can account for more than 7% of the immigrants coming into the US. This means that immigrants from large countries are less likely to immigrate in a timely fashion. This can be adjusted for the country based on the number of immigrants requesting citizenship. This way, immigrants won’t have to wait so long to come to the U.S.  A second major problem is female immigrates who faced domestic violence and qualified for asylum. In the past, U.S. laws helped protect these women, but a recent case removed these protections. They are then deported, and go back to their abusers without protection from the U.S. This defeats the purpose of their immigration and it’s likely they will face more abuse by the other group when they return. One specific case is about a woman from Honduras. She suffered sexual, physical and verbal violence by her intimate partner, and filed for asylum. Her case was denied because of matter of A-B-, which denied her protection. The last problem I will present is immigrant children being separated from their families at the border. Children are often separated from their families and this can be very traumatic, especially for younger children. Additionally, the current immigration process for family-based visas allows adults to be deported (to kick a person out of a country) while the child is still going through immigration court proceedings. This leaves the child feeling sad and alone without their parent(s). Instead, we can make sure the child and their family are together through the tough immigration process. This will send a positive massage to immigrants and other countries. It will also help children go through the immigration process easier. There are 3 major flaws of the immigration process covered in this essay. It is also demonstrated how the current immigration system has a bias against people of color and, in certain cases, females. It also presents the injustice of separating children from their families.
