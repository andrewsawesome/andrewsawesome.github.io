<title>Lyrics For The Hope</title>
<h3>Verse 1</h3>
<p>This is the hope. The hope is still real.</p>
<p>A Jewish home in Yisrael.</p>
<p>This is the time we stand as one</p>
<p>If not now when? We must be strong.</p>
<p>Our hearts turn to the East. Yeah!</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
This is the hope that holds us together! Hatikvah, the hope that will last forever.</p>
<p>This is the hope that holds us together! Hatikvah, the hope is still real</p>
<h3>Verse 2</h3>
<p>This is the hope, two thousand years</p>
<p>We pray for freedom through pain and tears.
<p>This is our faith. This is our voice</p>
<p>This is our promise. This is our choice.</p>
<p>Our hearts turn to the East. Yeah!</p>
<h3>Back to chorus</h3>
<p>Hatikvah, the hope is real</p>
<p>Hatikvah, our home Israel</p>
<p>Hatikvah, The hope is real</p>
