<title>Lyrics For The Hope</title>
<h3>Verse 1</h3>
<p>This is the hope. The hope is still real.</p>
<p>A Jewish home in Yisrael.</p>
<p>This is the time we stand as one</p>
<p>If not now when? We must be strong.</p>
<p>Our hearts turn to the East. Yeah!</p>
<h2>Chorus</h2>
This is the hope that holds us together! Hatikvah, the hope that will last forever.</p>
<p>This is the hope that holds us together! Hatikvah, the hope is still real</p>
<h2>Verse 2</h2>
