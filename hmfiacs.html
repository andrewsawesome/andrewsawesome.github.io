  <h1>How much Faster much faster is is to use a coin sorter than sorting by hand?</h1>
<p>I know that coin sorters are faster than hand sorting coins, but just how much faster are they than sorting by hand? I ran some tests. In Test 1, I have $3.03 worth of change. In test 2, I have $8.65 worth of change. I mixed both batches of coins between each test.
<p></p>
<h2>Test 1 Results</h2>
<p>Using a Coin Sorter:<strong>30 Seconds</strong></p>
<p>Sorting By Hand: <strong>1 minute and 17 seconds</strong></p>
<p>In this test the coin sorter was 47 seconds faster.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Test 2 Resulults</h2>
<p><strong>Note: This batch contained mostly quarters</strong></p>
<p>Coin Sorter: <strong>15 seconds</strong></p>
<p>Sorting By Hand: <strong>33 seconds</strong></p>
<p>In this test, the coin sorter was 18 seconds faster</p>
<p></p>

<p>The coin sorter used in this test was a Royal Soveriegn QS-1 Manual Coin Sorter. Picture Below.</p>
