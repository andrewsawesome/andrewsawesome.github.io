<title>Take it Easy Lyrics</title>
<p>Well, I'm running down down the road trying to loosen my load</p>
<p>I got seven women on my mind</p>
<p>Four that wanna own me</p>
<p>Two that wanna stone me</p>
<p>One says she's a friend of mine</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Take it easy, take it easy</p>
<p>Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy</p>
<p>Lighten up while you still can</p>
<p>Don't even try to understand</p>
Just Find a place to make your stand, and take It Easy</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Well, I'm standing on a corner in Windslow, Arizona</p>
<p>And such a fine sight to see</p>
<p>It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford, slowin' down to take a look at me</p>
<p.Come on, baby</p>
<p>Don't say Mabye</p>
<p>I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me</p>
<p>We may lose, and we may win</p>
<p>But we will never be here again</p>
<p>So open up, I'm climbin' in</p>
<p>So tkae it easy</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Well, I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load, got a world of trouble on my mind</p>
<p>Lookin' for a lover that won't blow my cover, she's so hard to find</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Take it easy, take ti easy</p.
<p>Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy</p>
<p>Come on baby, don't say mabye</p>
<p>I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me</p>
<p>ohhhhh, we got it easy</p>
<p>We oughta make it easy</p>
